    <h2></h2>
<p>Today I want to talk about a book called Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.</p>
<p><img src="https://FredrickI.github.io/theme/img/automate.jpg"></p>
<p>I came across this book when it was recommended to me by one of my clients. He happened to be a software engineer and I was looking for my next project after I finished CodeAcademy.You can buy the book on Amazon or view the free version online. There is also a youtube channel that follows the problems in the book.</p>
<p>Automate the Boring stuff is a good resource for beginners and professionals. If there are repetitive tasks that you have to do on the computer everyday then you can benefit from it.Each chapter teaches you an automation concept and has a mini project using that concept at the end.  It starts off by briefly going over the basics of Python. I had already learned this from CodeAcademy but it was a good refresher for me. I breezed through the first few chapters with no problems.</p>
<p>I started to learn new concepts with Chapter 7 that deals with Regular Expressions(re). CodeAcademy didn’t teach re in any of the lessons back when I used it. Regular Expressions allow you to find patterns inside of text kind of like “Ctrl+F”. You can use it to match words, phone numbers, emails….etc. It teaches you how to import the ‘re’ module and create a regex object and then use that to search text for a pattern.Its a very useful tool to know.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 and 9 were good chapters  about organizing files. I learned how to change directories, rename, copy , delete, and compress files.For example if you had 100’s of mp3’s with the “mp3” in the title and you wanted to remove it. You iterate over all of the files and change them in a couple of seconds versus clicking on each file one by one. The second way would take you forever. I played around with the directories on my own laptop and its alot of fun.</p>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways for me was how to launch programs from the command line. Up until this point I had done everything in the codeacademy terminal with training wheels. This book made me use the terminal and start from scratch.I learned that using the sys and subprocess modules you can open any program and run them from the command line. If your just starting out I would recommend getting used to the windows/linux + Python terminals. </p>
<p>Chapter 11 was a great chapter as well. It teaches you about web scraping using Beautiful Soup and Selenium libraries. Web scraping is extracting data from websites. Selenium lets you automate your web browser and Beautiful Soup extracts the data from html. Up until this point I hadn’t used html in years since a web design course in high school. I had to brush up on my html and then I went back and finished the chapter. There’s plenty of places to learn HTML and CSS on the web.</p>
<p>Overall Automate the Boring the Stuff is a good book. After I finished it I felt a lot more confident since I was able to create some real programs. They weren’t anything major but I learned the building blocks that I could now use to make something new. The first program I created after, sent me a text message of the fastest commute to work. It automated my web browser to go to google maps, search the shortest commute to work, and then send me the directions by text to the phone number I had on file. </p>
<p>Once again after I finished the book I was thinking “now what”? I felt more comfortable with the Python but I knew there was more to learn. The next project I worked on used DataCamp.com. I’ll be talking about that in my next article.</p>
