<p>Today I want to talk about a mobile app called Solo Learn. </p>
<p>It is an app for Iphone and Android where you can learn about many different programming languages, frameworks, and computer science concepts. Originally all the tutorials were separate apps but they were merged into one and more content was added. It also features a code playground/ide to run code, a forum to share ideas and ask questions, and daily articles on all things about code. Its really a cool little app to supplement your learning. </p>
<p>The programming language tutorials go over the basics like declaring variables, control flow, and data types. They also cover more advanced topics like classes and exception handling.Each example has a “Try it Yourself” link that lets you run the code inside the code playground. Its a nice feature, you can tweak the code or just run it as is. At the end of each tutorial there is a “more topics” button that gives you additional articles linked to the language. For example the Python course’s more topics button will show you how to implement different search and sort algorithms in Python. Its also linked to the Numpy tutorials and the Data Structures articles. I’ve taken the Python, JavaScript, GIt, and Algorithm tutorials with this app. </p>

<p>Solo Learn features a quiz challenge mode where you face off against other users. You can search to challenge people around your level or just select a random opponent. Both parties have to answer questions in the selected language. You get 40 seconds to answer 5 questions each. As you level up the questions get a lot harder. Its a good excercise to for reading code and keeping you on your toes. </p>
<p>The code playground is a built in ide for the app. When your learning a concept you can click the “Try It Yourself” button where you can run the code. Outside of the tutorials you can use the code playground to practice writing code. You can also upload your code  and share it with other users of the app. The most popular scripts are the cool animations in html, css, and javascript.</p>
<p>Overall Solo Learn is a really good app. I recommend it for anyone learning to program in any language. I use it as a refresher sometimes.ll log in to  challenge someone in Python or check on new articles. There are a lot of programming apps out now but this one’s been out for a while and its an editors choice on the google play store. Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>
