<p>Today I want to talk about how I was introduced to Python. </p>
<p>One day a couple of years ago, I was scrolling through tech articles on my phone. I came across an article of skills to learn by 30. One of the skills was coding and it mentioned some sources on how to start. I always wanted to learn so I did a little research.I decided to learn Python and I looked for websites that teach the language.</p>
<p>My first intro to Python came from CodeAcademy.com. Code Academy is a free website that teaches a few different programming languages including Python. Its a good first choice, tailored for beginners. The website takes away the need to install an interpreter on your computer because it comes with a built in terminal. It teaches you the basics of data types, syntax and control flow. </p>
<p>Enter picture here......</p>
<p>As I said its a good way to start but after I finished the course I was thinking "now what"? I had learn a bunch of concepts but didn't understand the significance. How does learning about a for loop and strings add up to creating facebook or snapchat? Programming has a tough learning curve but if you get over that initial part it all becomes clearer. </p>
<p>There are a lot of good apps and website for learning to code. In future posts I'll be talking more about the ones I've used. </p>
<p>You can install the latest version of Python on your machine at https://www.python.org/downloads/. It comes with the default interpreter IDLE but there are other cool IDE's like PyCharm, Emacs, and Jupyter Notebook.</p>
