<p>Welcome to my first article! For my first topic I want to talk about how I was introduced to Python and what I used to get started.  </p>
<p>About 3 years ago, I came across an article about skills to learn by age 30. They mentioned things like: cooking(still learning), speak a new language, play an instrument, and of course learn how to code. The article mentioned the different programming languages and how to get started. I always wanted to know how things worked behind the user interface. So after some research I decided to learn Python and looked for websites that teach the language.</p>
<p>Python is a good first language to learn. It is a high level , dynamic language that you can do many things with. From cyber security, to web development, or even data analysis. The syntax is easy to learn once you get use to the spacing. Python also has a large community with many libraries to assist with any projects your working on. I could go on a further tangent but yes Python is great!</p>
<p>My first intro to programming came from CodeAcademy.com. Code Academy is a free website that teaches you how to code with a few different programming languages including Python. Its a good first choice, tailored for beginners. The website takes away the need to install an interpreter because it comes with a built in terminal. It starts off by teaching you the basics of data types, syntax and control flow. Later on, it shows you more advanced concepts like using classes, importing files, and an intro to bitwise operators.</p>
<p><img src="https://fredricki.github.io/theme/img/screenshot.png"></p>
<p>Since I first started the site's been upgraded with a new UI and a paid "Pro Membership". The pro version gives you access to more content and you can chat with live advisors. </p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Code Academy is a good way to get started. After I finished the course though, I was thinking "now what"? I had learned a bunch of concepts but didn't understand the significance. How does creating a float, a string, importing the time module, or creating some random for loop turn into Google, Snapchat, or Spotify? Programming has a tough learning curve but it becomes more clear once you understand the basics. You really start to have fun and learn when you work on a project that your passionate about. I can say I've learned a lot just by working on this website. </p>
<p>For any one thinking about learning to code I would highly recommend it. Its a good skill you can use to automate tasks and make your day to day using a computer more efficient.There are a lot of good apps and websites to learn. In future posts I'll be talking more about the ones I've used. </p>
<p>You can install the latest version of Python on your machine at https://www.python.org/downloads/. It comes with the default interpreter IDLE but there are other cool IDE's(integrated development environments) like PyCharm, Emacs, and Jupyter Notebook. </p>
