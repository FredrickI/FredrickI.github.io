<p>Today I want to talk about a website called DataCamp.com(DC).</p>
<p>I came across DC after I finished with Automate the Boring Stuff.  Its another great website for beginners that teaches you how to use Python and R for data analysis. It comes with the built in terminal just like CodeAcademy but it also introduces you to Jupyter notebook which is an IDE for data visualization. Whether you want to do data analysis for a career or use it run a business I would recommend this site.</p>
<p><img src="https://FredrickI.github.io/theme/img/Datacamp.png"></p>
<p>The DC exercises come with a video instructor to explain some of the concepts you learn. CodeAcademy did not come with audio so if your an auditory learner this will be better for you.
DC gets you familiar with many different libraries for data analysis. I learned matplotlib to graph data, sqlalchemy to streamline database queries, and numpy and pandas to  import data into a dataframe. </p>
<p>To start with DC its free but there is a monthly subscription for 29.99. I would recommend it because you get access to the intermediate level courses which are really good. Actually the site’s been updated since I last used it and it has even more exercises and features.  </p>
<p>After using DC I felt like I had a pretty good foundation of the basics. I had decided after that it was a good idea to maybe learn about computer science. In my next article I’ll be talking about 
Edx.</p>
