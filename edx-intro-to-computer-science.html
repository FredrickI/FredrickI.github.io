<p>Today I want to talk about edX.org’s Introduction to Computer Science and Programming with Python. EdX.org is an open online course catalog with courses by some well known universities. This particular course is taught by MIT professors and they do a great job of explaining computer science to beginners. </p>
<p>MIT also has the video lectures from a couple of years back on their website at <a href “https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm”>https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm</a>. You can view them anytime along with many other topics from advanced algorithms to electrical engineering. I took the course on edX and watched the lectures at the same time.</p>
<p>Per Wikipedia ,computer science “is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers”. You can just learn how to code but if you have a deeper understanding of the how and why then it will make you a better a programmer.</p>
<p>This course while teaching you the basics of Python, references it to teach you the basics of computer science. The biggest takeaways for me were learning more about testing/debugging and an intro to algorithmic complexity. It’s important to know how fast your programs will run , especially as your data sets grow. So no nested loops and hash everything…..just kidding…..sort of.</p>
<p><img src="https://FredrickI.github.io/theme/img/edxorg.png"></p>
<p>After finishing, I felt really confident that I had a good understanding of Python. The next steps were to continue learning the more advanced programming concepts, learn another language,learn more about networking, and get familiar with different libraries. I continued looking for good resources to learn while thinking about what personal project or open source project I wanted to contribute to. Up until this point I’ve been learning and working by myself.</p>
<p>In the next article I’ll be talking about the SoloLearn mobile app. </p>
